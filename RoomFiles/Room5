[[VerbName]] [START4]Use[END4]
[[VerbResponse]] [START4]You present the beautiful seashell to Cetus, sure that he will now listen to you.

"Oh, I-I didn't expect you to actually find... Actually, I've, um, I-I've realized that I am actually far too busy to, uh, fix reality right now," he lies badly. "Maybe come back later?"

You don't move, and the great and noble deity, king of the gods, shifts uneasily on his throne, trying unsuccessfully to pretend that you aren't there.

He sighs. "Ok, fine. Look, just... just don't tell anyone alright but I, um, well... I sort of don't really know how to fix reality, that is. It's not my fault!" He adds quickly. "I'm not really used to being a god, you see. I'm just a sea monster. Sometimes Poseidon will tell me to go stop by a city, scare some people, eat a sacrifice, some such thing. I'm very good at it, too! I just, you know... it was just wrong place, wrong time. Zeus was visiting and I happened to be nearby, and I DIDN'T touch it, but reality... it, um... well somehow it fell and broke and next thing I know I'm wedged into this throne and being called king of the gods." By this point, the leviathan whale is in tears (which shouldn't be possible, but you're on Olympus, listening to a whale whining about breaking reality, so maybe this isn't the inaccuracy you should be worried about, eh?).

"Please, just help me, ok?" He begs. You assure him that you will do your best, mostly to stop the mammoth-sized teardrops that you have been dodging.[END4]
[[VerbHint]] [START4]The seashell looks quite beautiful. Maybe someone will want it?[END4]
