[[VerbResponse]] [START4]You eat a couple of pills. Almost immediately, you start feeling woozy and generally unpleasant. You check the pill bottle over once more, only now noticing that the expiration date is
January 7, 1984... That could be a problem. You manage to stumble over to the nearby bench before collapsing into unconsciousness. What feels like mere moments later, you open your eyes and sit up,
feeling wide awake. You stretch and stand up, but as you look to the south you notice a small, wooden door standing in the middle of the street. It doesn't seem to be attached to anything, so it
couldn't lead to anywhere... Could it?[END4]
[[VerbHint]] [START4]You should find somewhere to sleep before taking these unless you want to fall asleep on the ground.[END4]
