[[VerbResponse]] [START4]You look at the tape.

You look at reality.

You look back at the tape.

Slowly, you begin to tape the pieces of reality back together, half expecting something terrible to happen. With each piece that you haphazardly click back into place, a low rumble echoes up from below the clouds. After a few minutes, you've managed to fit everything back together, with one final strip, you circle the shattered globe a couple of times. A large earthquake wracks Olympus, sending you to your knees.

"That actually worked?!?" Cetus shouts over the din. "I can't believe it, but thank you! I think I can manage to make sure that you get back to your own place in reality, but you should hurry." He waves an awkward fin, a look of what you assume is concentration passing over the gigantic eye facing you. To the north, a pillar of mist winds its way up from the clouds below to form a shimmering tunnel. "I'd say I hope we meet again, but my job is normally crashing ships and generally causing problems for you lot, so... maybe not."[END4]
[[VerbHint]] [START4]Anything can be fixed with enough duct tape! Find something broken.[END4]
