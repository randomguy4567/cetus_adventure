[[FeatureLongDescription]] [START2]A bunch of seaweed and plastic is floating nearby, thankfully in the opposite direction of the shark. Among the other non-biodegradable knicknacks that will continue to float around the planet for decades, contributing to the slow decline of Earth's environment, is a flashlight. Despite the fact that it has probably been floating out here for a long time, I'd bet that it will somehow still work.[END2]

[[Verb]] [START3]
[[VerbName]] [START4]Use[END4]
[[VerbResponse]] [START4]Dodging around the many angry-looking soldiers, you slip into the cave and flick on the flashlight. Because this is a video game, the fact that you
found it bobbing in the ocean amidst a pile of trash does not at all affect its functionality, and it throws a beam of light over the stalactites. Able to now examine the
cave in greater detail, you realize that there is a passage in the back of the cave, leading who knows where. Either because you are feeling somewhat adventurous or because
you haven't forgotton that there are about to be quite a lot of drawn swords on the battlefield behind you in a moment, you sneak farther into the cave.

The passage is long, dark, narrow, and gently looping to one side. After what seems like ages, it begins to open up into another cave not unlike the first, with the minor exception
that this one's opening seems mostly hidden by a large rock. You think that you can squeeze through it, and decide to do so, popping out of what from the outsied looks like solid
rock mere feet above the enemy army's wall. Unfortunately your foot gets caught in a small crevice. You manage to pop it out, but the momentum sends you tumbling several feet... and
right into the commander of the enemy army! Fortunately, he seems to be as surprised as you are. Even more fortunately, it just so happens that he was standing right at the edge of
the wall. I say 'was' because, well... he's much closer at the moment. Impulsively, you try to reach out a hand to stop him, but manage only to snag his sword, wrenching it from
his grasp as he tumbles away.

By some miraculous twist of fate, you manage to escape back through the tunnel unnoticed. Unsurprisingly, you're not thinking clearly after having inadvertently murdered someone and
manage to drop both the flashlight and sword as you are stumbling out of the cave back on the battlefield. Although you can't seem to find the flashlight, the sword is hard to miss.[END4]
[[VerbHint]] [START4]Try to find someplace dark in order to use this.[END4]
