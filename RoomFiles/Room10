[[VerbResponse]]
[START4]"Excuse me?" You say, stepping up onto the platform.

The factory boss gives you a passing glance. "You one of the new ones? Protective gear is around the corner. Get to it!" After a few moments, he notices that you haven't left yet and turns
to face you "Well? What's wrong, didn't you hear me?" He asks, tapping on the metal guardrail impatiently.

"Well, actually..." you trail off.

His finger misses a beat. "You-your from upstairs, aren't you?" He asks, eyes bulging comically. "Terribly sorry, please forgive me. Busy day, you know how it is. You can tell Cetus that
despite the delays, everything is proceeding right on schedule. No need to worry, we'll have a hundred new realities ready for shipping by tomorrow, as discussed." He catches the blank look on
your face and apparently thinks that you are unimpressed rather than just clueless. He begins to sweat. "I-I was going to attach something personal for Cetus as well of course. I have quite a
nice seashell that my neice found the other day. You know how much he likes those."

From the other side of the factory, an alarm begins blaring. The bossman turns stark white, begins mumbling apologies and hurriedly waving over to some of the workers. You decide to back away before
you give the poor man a heart attack.[END4]
