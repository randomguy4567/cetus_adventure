[[Verb]] [START3]
[[VerbName]] [START4]Talk[END4]
[[VerbResponse]] [START4]You walk over to Cetus. In what I'm sure he imagines is a subtle glance, one of the giant eyes swivels towards you for a moment before quickly looking away.

"Excuse me," you say. The whale shifts in the throne, trying to twist away from you.

You wave, trying again to catch his attention. He pointedly ignores you. Finally, you grab a nearby pebble and chuck it at the irritating deity.

"Ouch!" He cries in a startlingly human-sounding voice. "Alright, alright already! What do you want?"

You ask him the obvious questions: Where are you? How did you get here? Why is he now a whale? Why is reality broken and can he fix it?

The large god seems to squirm in his throne. "Well, yes. About that, I... um..." He stutters, rubbing at his neck with a giant fin. "L-Look, I'm the god here, and I don't see why I should have to answer any of these questions or why I should be bothered to fix everything. Which I could very easily do! Maybe if you gave me something in ret -- I-I mean, you should, erm, know your place mortal! Thou must find a pleasing offering before Cetus will hear your request!" He declares with what appears to be a fumbling attempt at appearing appropriately regal.[END4]
[[VerbHint]] [START4]Cetus is trying to ignore you, but after all you've been through, I'd say you deserve at least a decent conversation.[END4]
