Welcome to Cetus. 

Spaceship
----------
You begin in an eerie spaceship. It seems deserted, but you can hear scratching coming from behind one of the walls. An elevator lies to the north. There is a large fire between you and a wall of the spaceship. There is burnt gadget of some sort nearby. A sheet of paper lies nearby.

> Beach
----------
You now find yourself on a sunny beach. Were it not for the strange objects dotting the scenery, it would be quite nice here. There is an elevator to the south. There is a path to the east. The ocean to the west. You see a stone outcropping. To the north, a giant, broken statue stands ominously.

> Ocean
----------
You are in the middle of the ocean. You are quite tired and the waves are quite rough. There is an island far to the west. There is a strong current to the south of you. There is land to the east. You see a pointed fin nearby. There is some flotsam floating towards you.

> Mall
----------
You find yourself in a shopping mall. Not another soul is around, and even the buildings seem deserted, with two exceptions. You suppose it makes more sense than the spaceship, but it still seems oddly out of place. There is an alley to the west. There is a store entrance to the north. The ocean is to the east. You see a plain wooden bench. There is a beautiful fountain nearby.

> You can't take that.

> There is a beautifully decorated fountain in the middle of a courtyard. As you peer in closer to it, you see a few handfuls of coins shimmering beneath the water's surface. There are coins in the fountain.

> The Coins is in your inventory.

> Arcade
----------
You find yourself in an old arcade. No one seems to be here and only one game is up and running. The arcade's exit is to the east. There is a rusty box on one wall. The one running game is "Frogger".

> You use your coins to play the frogger game. It is just as fun as you remember it. After thirty minutes or so, you're nearing the end of your quarters. Happening to glance down at the controls, you notice the Konami Code graffitied near the start button. Shrugging, you decide to enter it.

Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, B, A...

The game screen suddenly goes dark. Considering how much you were enjoying the game, this is quite annoying. Your irritation is put on hold for a moment, however, when you notice that, unlike all of the broken games around you, the screen before you isn't reflecting the dim, electric lights of the Arcade. Curious, you try to tap on the screen with your hand, only to find empty air. Peering closer, you realize that far beyond where the screen should end, there is a faint light..

> Unknown
----------
You find yourself... well it's unknown. To every side of you there is only an endless black void, although there seems to be some source of dim light that you can't find. A small hole hovering in the air leads West. One of the game developers is sitting against a desk, a computer on his lap. A desk out of an IKEA catalog is standing nearby.

> You can't open 

> I don't understand that.

> You go through the drawers, finding, among other things, markers for a non-existent whiteboard, two small slabs of wood whose purpose you can only guess at, an unopened copy of Plato's Complete Works, an unplugged PS4, and... a wallet. That last one might be useful..

> The Wallet is in your inventory.

> Arcade
----------
A retro arcade. There is a hole in place of the screen of the Frogger game. The arcade's exit is to the east. There is a rusty box on one wall. The one running game is "Frogger".

> Mall
----------
An urban shopping mall. There is an alley to the west. There is a store entrance to the north. The ocean is to the east. You see a plain wooden bench. There is a beautiful fountain nearby.

> Target
----------
You find yourself in a Target store. The bare shelves and the lack of any other people except for the smiling cashier give the place an unnerving feel. A back door is to the north. The store's exit is to the south. A cashier is waiting by one of the registers. There are rows and rows of shelves lining all of the aisles.

> You talk to the cashier, paying her for the old computer sitting on the shelf behind her with the developer's wallet. Spontaneously a giant fissure opens beneath you and swallows you whole, ending the game and deleting the 'Cetus' game files.

I'm kidding, of course. The cashier rings it up and places it on the counter for you..

> The Computer is in your inventory.

----------
You find yourself in a Target store. A back door is to the north. The store's exit is to the south. A cashier is waiting by one of the registers. There are rows and rows of shelves lining all of the aisles.

> There are rows and rows of shelves lining the aisles, but strangely all of them are completely bare. As you wander around, you notice that on one of the shelves there is a small bottle of sleeping pills. The sleeping pills are on the nearby shelves.

> The Pills is in your inventory.

> Mall
----------
An urban shopping mall. There is an alley to the west. There is a store entrance to the north. The ocean is to the east. You see a plain wooden bench. There is a beautiful fountain nearby.

> You eat a couple of pills. Almost immediately, you start feeling woozy and generally unpleasant. You check the pill bottle over once more, only now noticing that the expiration date is January 7, 1984... That could be a problem. You manage to stumble over to the nearby bench before collapsing into unconsciousness. What feels like mere moments later, you open your eyes and sit up, feeling wide awake. You stretch and stand up, but as you look to the south you notice a small, wooden door standing in the middle of the street. It doesn't seem to be attached to anything, so it couldn't lead to anywhere... Could it?.

> Dreamworld
----------
The dreamworld that you find yourself resembles a bare bedroom. There are no doors or windows, and the walls are made of a dull, gray concrete. You see an ornate bed. You see an old television.

> The old television set is playing a segment from Star Wars. As you approach, you see a droid whirring across the screen. The droid is in the tv, interfacing with the Death Star.

> The Droid is in your inventory.

> You climb onto the bed. It isn't too hard or soft, and soon you find yourself drifting away. A while later, you open your eyes. The door that you entered from is back. You're still not sure whether or not you're actually dreaming, but at the very least you now have a way out of the room..

> Mall
----------
An urban shopping mall. There is a mysterious door leading to the south. There is an alley to the west. There is a store entrance to the north. The ocean is to the east. You see a plain wooden bench. There is a beautiful fountain nearby.

> Arcade
----------
A retro arcade. There is a hole in place of the screen of the Frogger game. The arcade's exit is to the east. There is a rusty box on one wall. The one running game is "Frogger".

> Carefully, you reach up and try to open the box's door. It doesn't budge, its many layers of rust holding it in place. You try again, harder this time. Still nothing. Finally, you pull with all your might. The door flies off the box, clanging loudly as it bounces across an abandoned row of games. Inside, you find an unused fire extinguisher. It looks surprisingly new..

> The Extinguisher is in your inventory.

> Unknown

> Ocean
----------
The middle of the ocean. There is an island far to the west. There is a strong current to the south of you. There is land to the east. You see a pointed fin nearby. There is some flotsam floating towards you.

> Beach
----------
A sunny beach. There is an elevator to the south. There is a path to the east. The ocean to the west. You see a stone outcropping. To the north, a giant, broken statue stands ominously.

> Forest
----------
You are in a clearing in the middle of the forest. The sun is shining, the birds are singing. You half expect to see Bambi strolling through the underbrush nearby. There is a path to the west. An old trapper is nearby. You see a pile of leaves.

> You see a small pile of leaves gathered against a nearby bush. Sifting through it, you find a long roll of parchment bearing a long list of locations. The list of traps lies among the leaves.

> The List is in your inventory.

> Beach
----------
A sunny beach. There is an elevator to the south. There is a path to the east. The ocean to the west. You see a stone outcropping. To the north, a giant, broken statue stands ominously.

> Spaceship
----------
An eerie spaceship. An elevator lies to the north. There is a large fire between you and a wall of the spaceship. There is burnt gadget of some sort nearby. A sheet of paper lies nearby.

> The computer doesn't have any power. Try dropping this somewhere with an outlet..

> You need to input this into a computer, preferably one that's plugged in..

> You drop the Computer.

> The Computer is in your inventory.

> The droid's tools are whirring in anticipation. You better find it something to fix..

> You empty the extinguisher on the flames. Although the fire is far to large to fully contain, you do manage to clear a path through it. To the wall beyond. Beneath the colorful 'WELLS' PROPRIETARY TIME MACHINE, Not For Use On Organic Materials' label, you can now see a hatch leading to an adjacent chamber. Unfortunately, it seems that whatever catastrophe caused the fire also severely damaged the hatch, and it now is twisted on its hinges, its opening mechanism long since broken..

> You need to input this into a computer, preferably one that's plugged in..

> You drop the Computer.

> The Computer is in your inventory.

> You take the small droid out of your pack and place it on the floor beside the broken hatch. It whirrs away towards the door and within minutes the hatch has been repaired and freshly polished. Pushing open the hatch, you find a small chamber off to the side of the spaceship's main deck, it seems entirely empty minus a small container at the center..

> You drop the Computer.

> The Computer is in your inventory.

> You place the computer in the container in the center of the chamber. Oddly, there is even an outlet there for it, allowing you to turn it on for the first time. If you want to program it, you can probably do so now..

> You crouch down, quickly write out a brute force algorithm, and begin entering the list of traps into the computer.
Trap 1...
Trap 2...
Trap 3...
Trap 4...
Trap 5...
Trap 6...
Trap 7...
Trap 8...
Trap 9...
Trap 10...
Trap 11...

Ok, you know what? Let's just say that there is a, um... a sudden crash of thunder outside of the ship. Yes, that'll work. You turn to look at the wall, suddenly wondering how stable this broken-down ship is. In the brief second that you've turned your head, gremlins run out of a nearby mousehole, and at an almost unbelievable speed [but actually totally believable, trust me] they take the keyboard, enter in the hundreds of thousands of elements without any errors, and sprint away, leaving you to the pleasant surprise that the computer is now running the instance.

You shut the door to the capsule and lock it. After you do so, a small hatch opens in the floor nearby and a control console rises up out of it. On the console is a large, blinking red button..

> I don't understand that.

> Slowly, you put your hand on the giant, glowing button. After a moment spent intensely watching the canister, you push down. A small whirring noise starts up and the canister starts to vibrate slowly... The whirring noise grows louder and louder until it is an ear-splitting noise that you imagine is what it sounds like to slam gears together at very high speeds. The entire room has started to shake and the lights begin to flicker.

You know... In retrospect, trying to use a piece of super-advanced, reality-distorting technology on a spaceship where everything else is broken probably wasn't the best idea. Maybe run. NOW!

You sprint towards the exit, stumbling as the shaking reaches the intensity of a rather large earthquake. You throw yourself through the doors and put your hands over your head. As you are cowering in fear (sorry, but I call them as I see them), you realize that your nose is only a few inches away from the burnt gadget that you saw earlier. In spite of the fact that you might die at any moment, you are observant enough to notice a small hatch in the side of the gadget that you had previously missed. It might be something to investigate should you survive.

Suddenly, the shaking stops. A friendly 'Ding!' comes from the time machine, sounding very much like a cooking timer you would find at an elderly relative's house. Hesitantly, you get up and peer through the still quite shiny door. The computer is gone, vanished into the distant past..

> In the center of the time machine's chamber, the capsule contains a computer awaiting a program to execute. You are so very close now.

> You have Coins Wallet Pills Droid Extinguisher List Computer .

> You pry open the latch to the hidden compartment. Despite the fact that it seems nearly welded shut, you somehow manage to get it open. Inside of it is a small sheet of paper, containing lines and lines of writing. Upon closer inspection, you are shocked to find that it is a reordered version of the trapper's list. The answer to the trapper's traveling salesman problem! Surprised, you glance back at the burnt gadget and realize that it does look vaguely like that old computer that you just sent through the time machine, having finally run to completion. How and why it ended up outside of the chamber you cannot begin to guess, but I can guarantee that it is a riveting story of it's own. [pre-order the DLC now to find out the computer's tragic story, only $19.99 at select stores].

> The Answer is in your inventory.

> You can't go that way. You can go North

> Beach
----------
A sunny beach. There is an elevator to the south. There is a path to the east. The ocean to the west. You see a stone outcropping. To the north, a giant, broken statue stands ominously.

> Forest
----------
A peaceful forest grove. There is a path to the west. An old trapper is nearby. You see a pile of leaves.

> "Hello," the trapper says. "Don't get many visitors 'round these parts any more? You from that island place?" He picks at his teeth while he talks.
		
You relate to him the adventures that landed you here, to which he incrementally raises his eyebrow.

"A ship... in the sky... Where you met a god... uh-huh." The nature of his grin makes it very clear that he thinks you're nuts. He chuckles, "Well, I don't suppose your 'sky-ship god' would be able to help me with a trapping problem I'm having."

Although it's clear that he's joking about asking for help, you feel a bit offended by his implication that you're insane and press him into revealing the nature of his 'problem'.

Finally, he cracks. "Alright, see the problem is that all my buddies and I, we've set 'bout ten thousand traps in all round this forest. But it takes a while to check 'em all. If you figure out the quickest way to get between 'em, it'd save us all a bit o' trouble."

The traveling salesman problem. Really? REALLY? I'm starting to wonder if the game devs are just screwing with you at this point. You let out a deep sigh, your suspension of disbelief stretched to the breaking point. You attempt to explain to the the fur-laden trapper the nature of NP-completeness, but his eyes glaze over by the time you reach the part about polynomial time algorithms.

"Uh-huh...," he says, still very clearly thinking you're crazy. "Well if you and your magic sky-ship change your mind, I dropped the list of trap locations somewhere around here. Good luck with... stuff.".

> You give the answer sheet to the trapper, a triumphant smile on your face. He looks at the sheet, then looks back to you, surprised.
"Well... huh?" He scratches at his long beard thoughtfully. "I'm sure that I would have figured it out sooner or later [highly doubtful], but I suppose I should do something to thank you. One mo'"
He digs around in his shabby pack until eventually pulling out a rusty chisel. He tosses it off to the side as he re-ties the straps on his pack. "There, you're welcome to that. Don't righly know why I had it anyway.".

> The Chisel is in your inventory.

> Beach
----------
A sunny beach. There is an elevator to the south. There is a path to the east. The ocean to the west. You see a stone outcropping. To the north, a giant, broken statue stands ominously.

> Drawing on what I'm sure is your impeccable knowledge of nineteenth century English romantic poetry, you chisel the name OZYMANDIAS into the statue's base. As you carve the last letter, an eerie shimmer pulses through the air behind the statue, to your north. Growing larger and larger as it pulses ever faster, it soon seems to encompass the entire horizon..

> Camp
----------
You find yourself in an ancient war camp. It stinks badly, lots of people are shouting, and you're fairly certain that the horns blowing aren't a good thing. There is a strange ripple on the surface of the canyon wall to the south. A large, wooden gate looms to the north. There is an old chest nearby. Someone who appears to be the commander stands nearby.

> You pull open the chest to find an old coin purse nestled inside amidst a pile of armor. The purse looks fairly full..

> The Purse is in your inventory.

> Battlefield
----------
Outside of the war camp you find a vast battlefield. The two armies are squaring up to face each other here. Perhaps this isn't a place to dawdle. A large, wooden gate looms to the south. A ferry sits waiting for you on the river Styx to the north. The enemy army marches towards you menacingly. To the side of the battlefield, there is a cave.

> The coins in the purse all went out of print thousands of years ago, but I'm sure someone will want them..

> A passing captain puts a sword in your hands and directs you to the front lines. Your bag accidentally slips from your hand as you are moved forward and it is lost to the crowds. As the trumpets sound, you charge towards the enemy army along with thousands of others, their war cries echoing in your ears. You feel a rush of adrenaline and you feel truly alive. You then proceed to trip and skewer yourself on your sword. The mix of bleeding out and being trampled by an army doesn't do wonders for your health.

The next thing you know, you find yourself in a grim cavern, dark waters lapping at the shores nearby, flickering torches hung about the walls, throwing dancing shadows into the fog above the water. From deep within the fog bank comes a slow, repetetive sloshing of water. Slowly a figure emerges, cloaked in tattered rags and paddling an old, rickety ferry towards the bank of the river. He comes ashore and dismounts.

"Hello," he says, turning a skeletal grin towards you. "I'm Charon, ferryman of souls. Normally, I'd be here to take you to Hades." His grin lengthens as the color leaves your face. He seems to savor your worries for a moment. He sighs begrudgingly. "Unfortunately, I have a different destination for you. Olympus. Those are the orders from above, anyway. Consider yourself a most fortunate soul. But first..." he stretches out his hand. "The payment, please."

You reach for your bag but remember that you dropped it during the madness on the battlefield. You attempt to apologize, but Charon holds up his hand. "No payment, no service. Come back when you have it." He points towards a series of winding tunnels that seem to appear from nowhere. Vaguely wondering about how easy it was to get out of dying, you make your way up to the surface, finding yourself back upon the battlefield, your bag lying several feet near the cavern..

> An arcade would be a great place to use the coins..

> You make your way through the hidden turns and passages beneath the battlefield, finally arriving before Charon. You offer him the ancient purse, and from it he takes two ancient coins.

"This will do," he says, shrunken eyes gleaming with a sudden passion, pulling the coins into the depths of his ragged robe. "Cetus awaits," he announces, sweeping his hand in a bowing gesture to his ferry..

> Olympus
----------
You find yourself in Olympus, the home of the gods. Evidently they are very fond of statues of themselves. An ornate marble staircase runs to the south. A fragmented ball of reality lies on the ground nearby.

> You walk over to Cetus. In what I'm sure he imagines is a subtle glance, one of the giant eyes swivels towards you for a moment before quickly looking away.

"Excuse me," you say. The whale shifts in the throne, trying to twist away from you.

You wave, trying again to catch his attention. He pointedly ignores you. Finally, you grab a nearby pebble and chuck it at the irritating deity.

"Ouch!" He cries in a startlingly human-sounding voice. "Alright, alright already! What do you want?"

You ask him the obvious questions: Where are you? How did you get here? Why is he now a whale? Why is reality broken and can he fix it?

The large god seems to squirm in his throne. "Well, yes. About that, I... um..." He stutters, rubbing at his neck with a giant fin. "L-Look, I'm the god here, and I don't see why I should have to answer any of these questions or why I should be bothered to fix everything. Which I could very easily do! Maybe if you gave me something in ret -- I-I mean, you should, erm, know your place mortal! Thou must find a pleasing offering before Cetus will hear your request!" He declares with what appears to be a fumbling attempt at appearing appropriately regal..

> Spaceship
----------
An eerie spaceship. An elevator lies to the north. The button in the time machine's chamber glows red. There is a compartment that you missed before on the side of the burnt gadget. There is a large fire between you and a wall of the spaceship. The hatch to the time machine chamber seems broken. The time machine's chamber seems mostly empty, minus a canister in the center. In the center of the time machine's chamber, the capsule contains a computer awaiting a program to execute. There is burnt gadget of some sort nearby. A sheet of paper lies nearby.
