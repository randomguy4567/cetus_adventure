Welcome to Cetus. 

Spaceship
----------
You begin in an eerie spaceship. It seems deserted, but you can hear scratching coming from behind one of the walls. An elevator lies to the north. There is a large fire between you and a wall of the spaceship. There is burnt gadget of some sort nearby. A sheet of paper lies nearby.

> The game has been loaded from a saved state.
Forest
----------
A peaceful forest grove. There is a path to the west. An old trapper is nearby. You see a pile of leaves.

> "Hello," the trapper says. "Don't get many visitors 'round these parts any more? You from that island place?" He picks at his teeth while he talks.
		
You relate to him the adventures that landed you here, to which he incrementally raises his eyebrow.

"A ship... in the sky... Where you met a god... uh-huh." The nature of his grin makes it very clear that he thinks you're nuts. He chuckles, "Well, I don't suppose your 'sky-ship god' would be able to help me with a trapping problem I'm having."

Although it's clear that he's joking about asking for help, you feel a bit offended by his implication that you're insane and press him into revealing the nature of his 'problem'.

Finally, he cracks. "Alright, see the problem is that all my buddies and I, we've set 'bout ten thousand traps in all round this forest. But it takes a while to check 'em all. If you figure out the quickest way to get between 'em, it'd save us all a bit o' trouble."

The traveling salesman problem. Really? REALLY? I'm starting to wonder if the game devs are just screwing with you at this point. You let out a deep sigh, your suspension of disbelief stretched to the breaking point. You attempt to explain to the the fur-laden trapper the nature of NP-completeness, but his eyes glaze over by the time you reach the part about polynomial time algorithms.

"Uh-huh...," he says, still very clearly thinking you're crazy. "Well if you and your magic sky-ship change your mind, I dropped the list of trap locations somewhere around here. Good luck with... stuff.".

> You see a small pile of leaves gathered against a nearby bush. Sifting through it, you find a long roll of parchment bearing a long list of locations. The list of traps lies among the leaves.

> The List is in your inventory.

> Beach
----------
A sunny beach. There is an elevator to the south. There is a path to the east. The ocean to the west. You see a stone outcropping. To the north, a giant, broken statue stands ominously.

> Spaceship
----------
An eerie spaceship. An elevator lies to the north. There is a large fire between you and a wall of the spaceship. There is burnt gadget of some sort nearby. A sheet of paper lies nearby.

> You empty the extinguisher on the flames. Although the fire is far to large to fully contain, you do manage to clear a path through it. To the wall beyond. Beneath the colorful 'WELLS' PROPRIETARY TIME MACHINE, Not For Use On Organic Materials' label, you can now see a hatch leading to an adjacent chamber. Unfortunately, it seems that whatever catastrophe caused the fire also severely damaged the hatch, and it now is twisted on its hinges, its opening mechanism long since broken..

> You take the small droid out of your pack and place it on the floor beside the broken hatch. It whirrs away towards the door and within minutes the hatch has been repaired and freshly polished. Pushing open the hatch, you find a small chamber off to the side of the spaceship's main deck, it seems entirely empty minus a small container at the center..

> Beach
----------
A sunny beach. There is an elevator to the south. There is a path to the east. The ocean to the west. You see a stone outcropping. To the north, a giant, broken statue stands ominously.

> Ocean
----------
The middle of the ocean. There is an island far to the west. There is a strong current to the south of you. There is land to the east. You see a pointed fin nearby. There is some flotsam floating towards you.

> Mall
----------
An urban shopping mall. There is a mysterious door leading to the south. There is an alley to the west. There is a store entrance to the north. The ocean is to the east. You see a plain wooden bench. There is a beautiful fountain nearby.

> Target
----------
You find yourself in a Target store. A back door is to the north. The store's exit is to the south. A cashier is waiting by one of the registers. There are rows and rows of shelves lining all of the aisles.

> You talk to the cashier, paying her for the old computer sitting on the shelf behind her with the developer's wallet. Spontaneously a giant fissure opens beneath you and swallows you whole, ending the game and deleting the 'Cetus' game files.

I'm kidding, of course. The cashier rings it up and places it on the counter for you..

> The Computer is in your inventory.

> Spaceship
----------
An eerie spaceship. An elevator lies to the north. There is a large fire between you and a wall of the spaceship. The hatch to the time machine chamber seems broken. The time machine's chamber seems mostly empty, minus a canister in the center. There is burnt gadget of some sort nearby. A sheet of paper lies nearby.

> You place the computer in the container in the center of the chamber. Oddly, there is even an outlet there for it, allowing you to turn it on for the first time. If you want to program it, you can probably do so now..

> You crouch down, quickly write out a brute force algorithm, and begin entering the list of traps into the computer.
Trap 1...
Trap 2...
Trap 3...
Trap 4...
Trap 5...
Trap 6...
Trap 7...
Trap 8...
Trap 9...
Trap 10...
Trap 11...

Ok, you know what? Let's just say that there is a, um... a sudden crash of thunder outside of the ship. Yes, that'll work. You turn to look at the wall, suddenly wondering how stable this broken-down ship is. In the brief second that you've turned your head, gremlins run out of a nearby mousehole, and at an almost unbelievable speed [but actually totally believable, trust me] they take the keyboard, enter in the hundreds of thousands of elements without any errors, and sprint away, leaving you to the pleasant surprise that the computer is now running the instance.

You shut the door to the capsule and lock it. After you do so, a small hatch opens in the floor nearby and a control console rises up out of it. On the console is a large, blinking red button..

> Slowly, you put your hand on the giant, glowing button. After a moment spent intensely watching the canister, you push down. A small whirring noise starts up and the canister starts to vibrate slowly... The whirring noise grows louder and louder until it is an ear-splitting noise that you imagine is what it sounds like to slam gears together at very high speeds. The entire room has started to shake and the lights begin to flicker.

You know... In retrospect, trying to use a piece of super-advanced, reality-distorting technology on a spaceship where everything else is broken probably wasn't the best idea. Maybe run. NOW!

You sprint towards the exit, stumbling as the shaking reaches the intensity of a rather large earthquake. You throw yourself through the doors and put your hands over your head. As you are cowering in fear (sorry, but I call them as I see them), you realize that your nose is only a few inches away from the burnt gadget that you saw earlier. In spite of the fact that you might die at any moment, you are observant enough to notice a small hatch in the side of the gadget that you had previously missed. It might be something to investigate should you survive.

Suddenly, the shaking stops. A friendly 'Ding!' comes from the time machine, sounding very much like a cooking timer you would find at an elderly relative's house. Hesitantly, you get up and peer through the still quite shiny door. The computer is gone, vanished into the distant past..

> You pry open the latch to the hidden compartment. Despite the fact that it seems nearly welded shut, you somehow manage to get it open. Inside of it is a small sheet of paper, containing lines and lines of writing. Upon closer inspection, you are shocked to find that it is a reordered version of the trapper's list. The answer to the trapper's traveling salesman problem! Surprised, you glance back at the burnt gadget and realize that it does look vaguely like that old computer that you just sent through the time machine, having finally run to completion. How and why it ended up outside of the chamber you cannot begin to guess, but I can guarantee that it is a riveting story of it's own. [pre-order the DLC now to find out the computer's tragic story, only $19.99 at select stores].

> The Answer is in your inventory.

> Beach
----------
A sunny beach. There is an elevator to the south. There is a path to the east. The ocean to the west. You see a stone outcropping. To the north, a giant, broken statue stands ominously.

> Forest
----------
A peaceful forest grove. There is a path to the west. An old trapper is nearby. You see a pile of leaves.

> You give the answer sheet to the trapper, a triumphant smile on your face. He looks at the sheet, then looks back to you, surprised.
"Well... huh?" He scratches at his long beard thoughtfully. "I'm sure that I would have figured it out sooner or later [highly doubtful], but I suppose I should do something to thank you. One mo'"
He digs around in his shabby pack until eventually pulling out a rusty chisel. He tosses it off to the side as he re-ties the straps on his pack. "There, you're welcome to that. Don't righly know why I had it anyway.".

> The Chisel is in your inventory.

> Beach
----------
A sunny beach. There is an elevator to the south. There is a path to the east. The ocean to the west. You see a stone outcropping. To the north, a giant, broken statue stands ominously.

> Drawing on what I'm sure is your impeccable knowledge of nineteenth century English romantic poetry, you chisel the name OZYMANDIAS into the statue's base. As you carve the last letter, an eerie shimmer pulses through the air behind the statue, to your north. Growing larger and larger as it pulses ever faster, it soon seems to encompass the entire horizon..

> Camp
----------
You find yourself in an ancient war camp. It stinks badly, lots of people are shouting, and you're fairly certain that the horns blowing aren't a good thing. There is a strange ripple on the surface of the canyon wall to the south. A large, wooden gate looms to the north. There is an old chest nearby. Someone who appears to be the commander stands nearby.

> You pull open the chest to find an old coin purse nestled inside amidst a pile of armor. The purse looks fairly full..

> The Purse is in your inventory.

> Battlefield
----------
Outside of the war camp you find a vast battlefield. The two armies are squaring up to face each other here. Perhaps this isn't a place to dawdle. A large, wooden gate looms to the south. A ferry sits waiting for you on the river Styx to the north. The enemy army marches towards you menacingly. To the side of the battlefield, there is a cave.

> Dodging around the many angry-looking soldiers, you slip into the cave and flick on the flashlight. Because this is a video game, the fact that you found it bobbing in the ocean amidst a pile of trash does not at all affect its functionality, and it throws a beam of light over the stalactites. Able to now examine the cave in greater detail, you realize that there is a passage in the back of the cave, leading who knows where. Either because you are feeling somewhat adventurous or because you haven't forgotton that there are about to be quite a lot of drawn swords on the battlefield behind you in a moment, you sneak farther into the cave.

The passage is long, dark, narrow, and gently looping to one side. After what seems like ages, it begins to open up into another cave not unlike the first, with the minor exception that this one's opening seems mostly hidden by a large rock. You think that you can squeeze through it, and decide to do so, popping out of what from the outsied looks like solid rock mere feet above the enemy army's wall. Unfortunately your foot gets caught in a small crevice. You manage to pop it out, but the momentum sends you tumbling several feet... and right into the commander of the enemy army! Fortunately, he seems to be as surprised as you are. Even more fortunately, it just so happens that he was standing right at the edge of the wall. I say 'was' because, well... he's much closer at the moment. Impulsively, you try to reach out a hand to stop him, but manage only to snag his sword, wrenching it from his grasp as he tumbles away.

By some miraculous twist of fate, you manage to escape back through the tunnel unnoticed. Unsurprisingly, you're not thinking clearly after having inadvertently murdered someone and manage to drop both the flashlight and sword as you are stumbling out of the cave back on the battlefield. Although you can't seem to find the flashlight, the sword is hard to miss..

> The Sword is in your inventory.

> A passing captain puts a sword in your hands and directs you to the front lines. Your bag accidentally slips from your hand as you are moved forward and it is lost to the crowds. As the trumpets sound, you charge towards the enemy army along with thousands of others, their war cries echoing in your ears. You feel a rush of adrenaline and you feel truly alive. You then proceed to trip and skewer yourself on your sword. The mix of bleeding out and being trampled by an army doesn't do wonders for your health.

The next thing you know, you find yourself in a grim cavern, dark waters lapping at the shores nearby, flickering torches hung about the walls, throwing dancing shadows into the fog above the water. From deep within the fog bank comes a slow, repetetive sloshing of water. Slowly a figure emerges, cloaked in tattered rags and paddling an old, rickety ferry towards the bank of the river. He comes ashore and dismounts.

"Hello," he says, turning a skeletal grin towards you. "I'm Charon, ferryman of souls. Normally, I'd be here to take you to Hades." His grin lengthens as the color leaves your face. He seems to savor your worries for a moment. He sighs begrudgingly. "Unfortunately, I have a different destination for you. Olympus. Those are the orders from above, anyway. Consider yourself a most fortunate soul. But first..." he stretches out his hand. "The payment, please."

You reach for your bag but remember that you dropped it during the madness on the battlefield. You attempt to apologize, but Charon holds up his hand. "No payment, no service. Come back when you have it." He points towards a series of winding tunnels that seem to appear from nowhere. Vaguely wondering about how easy it was to get out of dying, you make your way up to the surface, finding yourself back upon the battlefield, your bag lying several feet near the cavern..

> You make your way through the hidden turns and passages beneath the battlefield, finally arriving before Charon. You offer him the ancient purse, and from it he takes two ancient coins.

"This will do," he says, shrunken eyes gleaming with a sudden passion, pulling the coins into the depths of his ragged robe. "Cetus awaits," he announces, sweeping his hand in a bowing gesture to his ferry..

> Camp
----------
An ancient war camp. There is a strange ripple on the surface of the canyon wall to the south. A large, wooden gate looms to the north. There is an old chest nearby. Someone who appears to be the commander stands nearby.

> You walk up to the commander of the war camp. He barely glances at you before waving for a squadron of guards to escort you away. You quickly pull out the sword. Two dozen other swords are suddenly very close to your throat. Thinking that there was probably a safer way to do this, you quickly explain the sword's origin to the commander, along with telling him of the existence of the tunnel to the enemy encampment. A nearby soldier snorts his contempt and moves to end your story quickly.

"Wait," the commander says, suddenly interested in your presence. "Let us see if this stranger is telling the truth. If not, do what you will." He turns and barks an order at one of the nearby men, who runs off toward the battlefield to confirm your story.

You wait somewhat uneasily, still surrounded by quite a few more swords than you feel comfortable with. After what seems like far too long, the scout runs back into camp breathless. He nods. Suddenly, the blades are away and several officers are patting you on the back.

After a quick conversation and several more runners to and from the battlefield, the commander motions you away from the crowd, and you join him a little way away from the crowd.

"I must say, I'm impressed," the commander says. You remind him that both your discovery and the death of the enemy general were complete accidents. He chuckles. "I'd rather have a half-dozen men as lucky as you are than half an army of brave idiots." Walking over to a small tent, he motions you to wait as he goes inside. Moments later, the commander emerges with a small box.

"A while ago, my men found an artifact made of material unlike any that we have ever seen, covered with fantastic runes A tool of the gods, we believe. Consider it payment for your service." He places the box on the table and opens the lid.

It's a roll of duct tape. Duct tape decorated with hearts and stars which probably once belonged to the arts-and-crafts supplies of a small child.

The commander smiles. "I see you are dumbfounded by its beauty. Take your time to admire it. As I mentioned, it is now yours." He turns and walks away, leaving you to stare incredulously at the roll of tape..

> The Tape is in your inventory.

> Battlefield
----------
A battlefield outside of the war camp. A large, wooden gate looms to the south. A ferry sits waiting for you on the river Styx to the north. The enemy army marches towards you menacingly. To the side of the battlefield, there is a cave. In the winding tunnels beneath the battlefield, Charon waits for you.

> Olympus
----------
You find yourself in Olympus, the home of the gods. Evidently they are very fond of statues of themselves. An ornate marble staircase runs to the south. A fragmented ball of reality lies on the ground nearby.

> You walk over to Cetus. In what I'm sure he imagines is a subtle glance, one of the giant eyes swivels towards you for a moment before quickly looking away.

"Excuse me," you say. The whale shifts in the throne, trying to twist away from you.

You wave, trying again to catch his attention. He pointedly ignores you. Finally, you grab a nearby pebble and chuck it at the irritating deity.

"Ouch!" He cries in a startlingly human-sounding voice. "Alright, alright already! What do you want?"

You ask him the obvious questions: Where are you? How did you get here? Why is he now a whale? Why is reality broken and can he fix it?

The large god seems to squirm in his throne. "Well, yes. About that, I... um..." He stutters, rubbing at his neck with a giant fin. "L-Look, I'm the god here, and I don't see why I should have to answer any of these questions or why I should be bothered to fix everything. Which I could very easily do! Maybe if you gave me something in ret -- I-I mean, you should, erm, know your place mortal! Thou must find a pleasing offering before Cetus will hear your request!" He declares with what appears to be a fumbling attempt at appearing appropriately regal..

> You present the beautiful seashell to Cetus, sure that he will now listen to you.

"Oh, I-I didn't expect you to actually find... Actually, I've, um, I-I've realized that I am actually far too busy to, uh, fix reality right now," he lies badly. "Maybe come back later?"

You don't move, and the great and noble deity, king of the gods, shifts uneasily on his throne, trying unsuccessfully to pretend that you aren't there.

He sighs. "Ok, fine. Look, just... just don't tell anyone alright but I, um, well... I sort of don't really know how to fix reality, that is. It's not my fault!" He adds quickly. "I'm not really used to being a god, you see. I'm just a sea monster. Sometimes Poseidon will tell me to go stop by a city, scare some people, eat a sacrifice, some such thing. I'm very good at it, too! I just, you know... it was just wrong place, wrong time. Zeus was visiting and I happened to be nearby, and I DIDN'T touch it, but reality... it, um... well somehow it fell and broke and next thing I know I'm wedged into this throne and being called king of the gods." By this point, the leviathan whale is in tears (which shouldn't be possible, but you're on Olympus, listening to a whale whining about breaking reality, so maybe this isn't the inaccuracy you should be worried about, eh?).

"Please, just help me, ok?" He begs. You assure him that you will do your best, mostly to stop the mammoth-sized teardrops that you have been dodging..

> You look at the tape.

You look at reality.

You look back at the tape.

Slowly, you begin to tape the pieces of reality back together, half expecting something terrible to happen. With each piece that you haphazardly click back into place, a low rumble echoes up from below the clouds. After a few minutes, you've managed to fit everything back together, with one final strip, you circle the shattered globe a couple of times. A large earthquake wracks Olympus, sending you to your knees.

"That actually worked?!?" Cetus shouts over the din. "I can't believe it, but thank you! I think I can manage to make sure that you get back to your own place in reality, but you should hurry." He waves an awkward fin, a look of what you assume is concentration passing over the gigantic eye facing you. To the north, a pillar of mist winds its way up from the clouds below to form a shimmering tunnel. "I'd say I hope we meet again, but my job is normally crashing ships and generally causing problems for you lot, so... maybe not.".
