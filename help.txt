Welcome to Cetus, a text-based adventure game where you are the hero! Well, more accurately, you're the poor guy who woke up in a spaceship, having no idea how he got there and suddenly having to figure out what the hell is going on. But really, what's the difference.

ABOUT THE GAME

'Cetus' is composed of fifteen separate areas or "rooms" that you will have to discover and explore. Each of these rooms will contain various features to interact with and objects that you might be able to make off with if no one is looking. To navigate between rooms, you must go through the various doors, passageways, magic portals, etc. that you find scattered around the areas that you land in. Whenever one of these passages, environmental features or objects is mentioned by the narrator (yours truly), I'll highlight them in a different color to help you out. Sometimes he'll even help you out by mentioning an action that can affect one of those objects. For example: attack statue.

Of course, I wouldn't want to make the game too easy on you, so sometimes a highlighted word will reference an object or pathway that isn't in the current area, but that you'll have to hunt around the map to find. They could be the key to progressing in the game if your stuck... or they could just be red herrings! It's up to you to figure out.

Now, that might make me seem a little mean, but I swear I'm (usually) on your side, so if you are having trouble figuring out how to use an object, just try any command on it and I'll give you a hint about where you might find a use for it. You'll find a list of these commands below.

Now that I've bored you with the technical details, go out and explore the world. Happy adventuring!
